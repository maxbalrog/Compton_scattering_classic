# Compton_scattering_classic
Repository for calculation of Compton emission spectra based on electron's trajectory (classical framework)

**ComptonSpec_classic.py** - classes necessary for computation

**class_usage.ipynb** - demonstration of class usage

**Benchmarks.ipynb** - several benchmarks (analytics with rectangular laser pulse,
Thomson cross section, comparison with quantum and VDSR simulations)
